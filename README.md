Web Frontend for Yaptest

Work in progress: This project has not yet been moved to google code.  See also the [http://pentestmonkey.net/projects/yaptest/yaptestfe-overview/ official homepage].

YaptestFE is a Web Frontend for Yaptest.  As of version 0.9 it allows viewing of much of the information in the database used by Yaptest.

The Frontend is designed to complement the command line interface.  Sometimes it's more convenient to browse the database using this web interface.  Other times it's more appropriate the use the command line utilities to grep and cut the data required.

The Frontend is optional: it is not required in order to use Yaptest.
